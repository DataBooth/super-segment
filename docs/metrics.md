### **Understanding Clustering Metrics for Segmentation**

The table below summarises the key metrics used to evaluate the quality of member segmentation:

| Metric              | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Silhouette Score**| Measures how similar each member is to their own segment compared to other segments. Ranges from -1 (poor) to +1 (excellent). Higher is better. |
| **Cluster Size**    | The number of members assigned to each segment. Useful for understanding segment distribution and ensuring no segment is too small or too large. |
| **Inertia**         | The sum of squared distances of members to their assigned cluster centre (lower is better). Used internally by KMeans. |
| **Segment Profile** | The average feature values for each segment, helping interpret and describe the characteristics of each group. |

---

**How to interpret:**

- **High silhouette score** (closer to 1) indicates well-separated, cohesive segments.
- **Balanced cluster sizes** suggest that segments are meaningful and not dominated by a single group.
- **Low inertia** (for KMeans) means members are close to their segment centre, but should be used alongside silhouette score.
- **Segment profiles** help you understand and actionably describe each segment for business use.

**Example:**

| Segment | Size  | Silhouette Score | Avg Age | Avg Balance | Most Common Profession | ... |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|-----|
| 0       | 22,500| 0.41             | 37      | $55,000     | Primary Teacher       |     |
| 1       | 25,000| 0.38             | 51      | $120,000    | High School Teacher   |     |
| ...     | ...   | ...              | ...     | ...         | ...                   |     |

### **Understanding Clustering Metrics for Segmentation**

The table below summarises key metrics for evaluating the quality and business usefulness of member segmentation:

| Metric                   | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Silhouette Score**     | Measures how similar each member is to their own segment compared to other segments. Ranges from -1 (poor) to +1 (excellent). Higher is better. |
| **Cluster Size**         | The number of members assigned to each segment. Useful for understanding segment distribution and ensuring no segment is too small or too large. |
| **Inertia**              | The sum of squared distances of members to their assigned cluster centre (lower is better). Used internally by KMeans. |
| **Davies-Bouldin Index** | Evaluates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, based on the ratio of within-cluster scatter to between-cluster separation. **Lower values indicate better clustering** (compact, well-separated clusters)[1][2][3][4][5][8]. |
| **Calinski-Harabasz Index** | The ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. **Higher values indicate better-defined, well-separated clusters**[6][9][11]. |
| **Segment Profile**      | The average feature values for each segment, helping interpret and describe the characteristics of each group. |

#### **Advanced Metrics Explained**

**Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI):**
- **What it measures:** The average “worst-case” similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, balancing compactness (tightness within clusters) and separation (distance between clusters).
- **Formula:**  
  For each cluster, calculate the ratio of within-cluster scatter to the distance between centroids, then average the maximum ratios across all clusters.
- **Interpretation:**  
  - **Lower DBI** (closer to 0) = better clustering (tight, well-separated clusters).
  - **Higher DBI** = clusters are less distinct or more dispersed[1][2][3][4][5][8].

**Calinski-Harabasz Index (Variance Ratio Criterion):**
- **What it measures:** The ratio of between-cluster variance (how far apart clusters are) to within-cluster variance (how tight each cluster is).
- **Formula:**  
  $$
  \text{CH} = \frac{\text{Between-cluster dispersion} / (k-1)}{\text{Within-cluster dispersion} / (n-k)}
  $$
  Where $k$ is the number of clusters and $n$ is the number of samples[9][11].
- **Interpretation:**  
  - **Higher CH Index** = better clustering (clusters are compact and well-separated).
  - **Lower CH Index** = clusters are less distinct or more dispersed.

#### **Business Actionability Measures**

| Metric/Check                  | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Segment Size Practicality** | Are segments large enough to target with tailored communications or products?                    |
| **Distinctiveness**           | Are the average characteristics of each segment meaningfully different for business strategy?    |
| **Stability**                 | Do segments remain consistent over time or with new data samples?                                |
| **Actionability**             | Can each segment be mapped to a clear business action (e.g., targeted advice, product offer)?    |
| **Coverage**                  | Does every important member group appear in at least one segment?                                |

**How to interpret:**

- **High silhouette score** and **high Calinski-Harabasz index** indicate strong, actionable segmentation.
- **Low Davies-Bouldin index** means clusters are compact and well-separated.
- **Actionability** is about whether segments can be used to drive real business decisions (not just statistical groupings).

**Note:**  
Unlike classification, segmentation does not have “precision” or “recall” because there are no ground-truth segment labels. Metrics focus on how well the data clusters and how useful the segments are for business objectives.
